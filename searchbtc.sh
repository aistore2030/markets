# Help -- run with -h
HELP="This script uses Vanitygen to generate an address and its private key.
It then checks for at least one received transaction at the public address. 
If a transaction is detected, even if the balance is currently nought, a copy 
of the generated private key and its public address will be printed in the 
screen and logged to ~/ADDRESS.

It uses two APIs: blockchain.info and blockchair.com. if you want to try
and use only blockchain.info, use option \"-b\".

Required packages are: Bash, Vanitygen, OpenSSL, Pcre and JQ.


Blockchain.info rate limits, from Twitter 2013:

	\"Developers: API request limits increased to 28,000 requests per 8 hour
	period and 600 requests per 5 minute period.\"


Blockchair.com API docs:

	\"Since the introduction of our API more than two years ago it has been free to use in both non-commercial and commercial cases with a limit of 30 requests per minute.\"

	It seems that you can create a blockchair.com API key for more requests
	/min. Add it to the CHAIRKEY variable in the script source code.


Options:
	-b 	Use only the blockchain.info API.

	-c 	Use only the blockchair.com API.

	-d 	Debug, prints server response on error.

	-h 	Show this help.

	-s 	Sleep time (seconds) between new queries; defaults=10.

	-v 	Print this script version."
